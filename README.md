# custom-linux-tooling
My own collection of linux development tools

# Rationale
Just some random tools that I've learned built in order to sharpen my bash scriptings skills 
and automation technique. 
- My initial bash scripts looks very odds because I try to write it 
the in programming semantics instead of scriptings like it is. HUGE MISTAKES! 
- Anyway will improve in the later versions ://

# Winter is coming
- More tools will be coming soon! ;) Including additional python scripts and
VM/Libvirt/Qemu stuffs!

# Notes : 
Thanks you for stopping by. If you don't mind , just scout through my scripts and critics my code 
if possible. Can send me some suggestion in the issues / more features to improve the codes. Thanks you!.
